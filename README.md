# Turtle-Crossing-Game
Avoid all the cars and help the turtle cross safely.
# How To Play
Use the up arrow key to make the turtle move forward. If the turtle collides with a car, it's game over. When the turtle crosses safely, the turtle's position is reset
and speed of car increases. The turtle can only move forward.
